    <Block title="Summary">
      <p class="text-xl">
        My role in the project was to take an existing application from any
        realm possible (desktop, tablet, mobile, coffee machine…) and redesign
        it using the emotional design principles. As the application, I chose
        something I use every week if not every day: <a
          href="https://www.splitwise.com/">Splitwise</a
        >. I then created wireflows and an emotional map of the application and
        made it more emotional.

    <Block title="Background">
      <p>
        The project aimed to choose an application that I used every day and
        redesign it to apply the emotional design principles. I chose Splitwise
        as my application as it is something that I use every week if not every
        day.
      </p>

      <img
        class="object-contain bg-center transition max-w-full rounded-lg"
        src="/images/splitwise/interaction-map.jpg"
        alt="An interaction map of the Splitwise application's expense-adding flow."
      />
      <small class="-mt-6"
        >An interaction map of the Splitwise application's expense-adding flow.</small
      >

      <p>
        When creating the interaction map, I also created an emotional map of
        the application – which emotions I felt during adding an expense or
        settling expenses in the application. The main emotions I found were:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li class="text-xl">– Curious (whether I've had any new expenses)</li>
        <li class="text-xl">
          – Confused (the expense-adding flow got confusing at times)
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl">– Relieved & Liberated (when settling up)</li>
      </ul>

        Me and my coursemates at <Link
          title="IxD.ma"
          href="https://ixd.ma/"
          keepXl
        /> did an exercise where we went through everyone's application and everyone
        could add feedback or ideas for the application. The result looked very nice
        and colorful (my column is the first one on the left):
      </p>

      <img
        class="object-contain bg-center transition max-w-full rounded-lg"
        src="/images/splitwise/ideation.jpg"
        alt="An interaction map of the Splitwise application's expense-adding flow."
      />

      <p>
        As you might see from the image, I created a how-might-we question and 4
        simple design principles to guide me on my way. The how-might-we
        question was the following:
      </p>

      <p>
        How might we create a more engaging and emotionally satisfying
        experience for users when they enter their expenses on Splitwise so that
        it feels less like a chore and more like a fun and rewarding activity?
      </p>

      <p>And the four design principles guiding me on my way were:</p>

      <ul>
        <li class="text-xl">– Reward!</li>
        <li class="text-xl">– Simplify!</li>
        <li class="text-xl">– Surprise!</li>
        <li class="text-xl">– Empower!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There were lots of great suggestions from my coursemates. I packaged
        them all into one and got the result.

      <ProjectImage

        alt="Three mockups of the initial screens."
      />

      <p>
        With the subtle background color, I hoped to evoke the sense of urgency,
        but at the same time, a quick overview. Same with the colored dots in
        the dropdown – at a glance you can see whether you're in a "good
        position" or a "bad position". The emojis will also show what the
        balance is and will try to evoke a sense of understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also hid the balance of the group or with your friend behind a click
        so it wouldn't be the first thing you see when opening the application.
        It is sort of a way to procrastinate paying up, but also reduces the
        anxiety around immediately having to pay up.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Figma board, which is below, I also created a couple of
        notifications to remind the person about the balance.
