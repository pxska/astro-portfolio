I recently acquired a copy of Steve Klein's book "Steal Like an Artist." I have gone through it multiple times and always seem to find something that resonates with me. One quote that has stuck with me is:

> "The artist is a collector. Not a hoarder, mind you, there's a difference: Hoarders collect indiscriminately, artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love."

Before switching to [Arc browser](https://arc.net/), I heavily used Chrome's bookmarking feature. I had multiple folders filled with interesting, educational, and captivating articles, resources, and visuals. However, after transitioning to Arc, I felt like I no longer had a "junk drawer" due to how bookmarking works in Arc.

I began searching for a new way to curate things I truly love. Initially, I came across [Mind](https://mymind.com/), a browser extension that made it easy to save images, thoughts, and resources. However, I found that my mind tends to wander too much, leading to a cluttered visual appearance in Mind.

Then, I discovered [Rauno Freiberg's](https://x.com/raunofreiberg) [bmrks](https://bmrks.com/). I appreciate being able to quickly add notes, links, or anything else to a list and revisit them when seeking inspiration. To streamline my process, I also utilize a Raycast extension for bookmarking â€“ it greatly simplifies my life.

I have not yet become a power user of bookmarks, as I have not created different groups for various types of bookmarks. However, I plan to do so, as it would make finding specific inspiration related to a particular topic much easier.
