        The goal of the project was to offer a life insurance company named
        <Link href="https://www.invl.ee/en/" title="INVL" keepXl />
        a way to get out of the "red ocean" and reach the <Link

          title='"blue ocean"'

    <Block title="Background">
      <p>
        The challenge at hand seemed simple at first – make more people pay for
        life insurance. The idea seemed simple as well: why not get life
        insurance? If something happens to you or a close loved one, the life
        insurance money that you receive ensures that you won't be on your back
        after an accident of some sort. It seemed simple enough to understand
        that once you have paying customers, they will probably want to stay for
        a lifetime. But it was definitely not that simple.
      </p>

    <Block title="More research…">
      <p>
        Our course kicked off the course with a presentation from the customer.
        To me, the presentation seemed more like a presentation for selling us
        life insurance instead of explaining how the company actually works and
        what life insurance actually is. We took it upon ourselves to deep dive
        into all things life insurance, such as company insights, industry
        analysis, competitive overview, interviews with stakeholders and so much
        more. We definitely reached the point of lag due to so many sticky notes
        on our Miro board quite quickly.
      </p>

      <small class="-mt-6"
        >I was put in charge of putting the post-its from Miro onto the wall.</small
      >

      <p>
        After that, we tried to make sense of all the data we had gathered. To
        do this, I teamed up with my coursemate Zac to create a presentation for
        the INVL representatives, but at the same time the whole course started
        creating small snippets to be put into the presentation. We also created
        a few affinity maps and, to our surprise, immediately saw many types of
        personas emerging, such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li class="text-xl">
          – person shying away from insurance & thinking about <strong
            >alternatives</strong
          >, such as investing
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl">
          – <strong>procrastinator</strong>, who is constantly delaying getting
          life insurance due to being busy
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl">
          – person with <strong>barriers</strong> due to life insurance being too
          expensive for them
        </li>
        <li class="text-xl">
          – person with <strong>prejudice</strong> against life insurance due to
          previous experiences
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We then presented all our findings to the INVL representatives, who were
        very avid to learn what we are going to come up with.
      </p>
    </Block>
    <Block title="Our persona & his journey">
      <p>
        We divided the course into groups of three and started figuring out who
        the personas are in the life insurance journey. Our team came up with
        Margus, who is 35 years old and works as a back-end developer. Margus is
        the person of <strong>alternatives</strong> – he doesn't believe necessarily
        in insurances, unless it comes with the products he's buying. He lifes life
        to the fullest and loves to spend his money.
      </p>

      <ProjectImage
        src="/images/invl/margus-persona.jpg"
        alt="Our persona's, Margus' persona board"
      />
      <small class="-mt-6">Our persona's, Margus' persona board</small>

      <p>
        After creating a persona, we also mapped out the user journey for Margus
        to find the drop-off points in his journey.
      </p>

        alt="Our persona's, Margus' user journey"
      />
      <small class="-mt-6">Our persona's, Margus' user journey</small>

      <p>
        Everyone in our team got a point of focus – for me it was the needing
        help & maintenance section, where Margus' mom turns 70 years old, loses
        her life insurance contract and all the money she has paid into it for
        many years.

    <Block title="Developing">
      <p>
        Out of the problem mentioned in the previous section, I started out with
        the following "How might we…" question:
      </p>

      <p>
        How might we ensure that the person feels valued after their contract
        ends and that their money didn't vanish into thin air?
      </p>

      <p>
        As the insurance business relies heavily on getting positive
        recommendations from current customers, the offboarding process is very
        important. If the person doesn't feel valued after they become 70, why
        would they recommend getting the insurance to others?
      </p>

      <p>
        During many ideation rounds, I stumbled upon a very weird solution,
        which I initially thought of as a joke, but which turned out to be a
        very real idea.
      </p>
    </Block>

    <Block title="Solution">
      <p><strong>Give the customer back all the money they've paid.</strong></p>

      <p>
        It might sound crazy from a business perspective, but it is actually
        <Link
          href="https://www.progressive.com/answers/return-of-premium-life-insurance-rider"
          title="already being done by some big insurance firms in the U.S."
          keepXl
        />, and quite successfully so. Insurance companies usually make profit
        by investing the money that they receive from the customers and even if
        the customer is paid out some amount of it, the insurance firm usually
        stays in a profit.
      </p>

      <p>
        I proposed a solution in which they ask their customers for a bit more
        money each month, and depending on however big their investment margins
        are, they can then make a profit during the time the customer is paying
        to the company and then even pay them back the money if possible. This
        means that the insurance becomes a savings account for people. To
        explain and illustrate the idea, I presented a <em>wicked</em> Excel sheet.
      </p>

      <p>
        And, of course, who wouldn't love to get an envelope full of cash for
        their time as a pensioner.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the presentation, I immediately saw interest from INVL towards
        this idea; got an A for the course and finished the year with a smile on
        my face.
