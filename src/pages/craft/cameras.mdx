We live in the age of smartphones, where taking pictures has become second nature and a mundane task. With my trusty iPhone, I could snap a picture anytime, anywhere, and the convenience was hard to beat. However, over time, I realized something was missing. Photography started to feel too easy and automatic, and the act of capturing a moment lost its significance. That's why a few months ago I decided to pick up a used Fujifilm X100F from Facebook Marketplace—and everything changed.

With a dedicated camera, I am reminded that photography is more than just pointing and shooting. Using a camera forces me to acknowledge the moment. Before I press the shutter, I think about the composition, the light, and what I'm really trying to capture. It's like a ritual. Every time I take the camera out, it feels like I'm about to create something meaningful. In a world where taking pictures with a phone has become so casual, using a camera allows me to reconnect with the artistry of photography.

One thing I absolutely love about Fujifilm cameras is their film simulations. I've been exploring recipes online and trying out different styles, and the results make me feel like I'm shooting on actual film. It gives my photos a certain depth and character that I never experienced with my phone. There's a warmth and texture to the images that feels almost nostalgic yet fresh and exciting. It makes every shot more intentional, and I find myself spending more time considering how the final image will look.

I particularly enjoy capturing architecture, shadows, and light. I'm fascinated by how light interacts with buildings and how shadows fall in unexpected patterns. Having a dedicated camera has heightened my awareness of these details. I'm constantly searching for that perfect alignment of light and structure, and the satisfaction of capturing it with a camera, rather than a phone, feels different. It feels like I'm truly creating something. With a phone, it's just a quick tap on the screen. But with the camera, I'm part of the process—thinking, waiting, and then pressing the shutter at the right moment.

To be honest, I don't enjoy photographing people as much. I think this stems from being a people-pleaser. I worry that if I take someone's photo and show it to them, they might not like it, which makes the whole effort feel unworthy. When I'm photographing architecture or light, I don't have to worry about anyone's opinion. It's just me, my camera, and the moment. And that's how I like it.

There's also something about using a camera that feels cool. Walking around with a camera slung over my shoulder, ready to take a shot, feels different from pulling out a phone. There's a certain aesthetic to it. A camera stands out—it feels like I'm carrying an artist's tool, something designed for a purpose. This changes how I approach photography. It's not just about capturing a moment; it's about capturing it with intention and style. It makes me feel like I'm doing more than just taking pictures—I'm creating art.

Switching to the Fujifilm X100F has reignited my love for photography. It's not just about the photos themselves, but the process of taking them. Slowing down, being in the moment, and then pressing the shutter—that's what makes it special. I'm no longer just documenting life; I'm turning those moments into something personal and worth remembering.
