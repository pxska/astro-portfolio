    As with multiple product designer portfolios you've seen lately, I, too, share a love for photography. I usually do not know what I am doing and just set every setting possible to automatic, but I definitely feel I have taken a few cool images over the years.

    <Image class="rounded-lg" src={carPhoto01} alt="A photo of an old-looking car." />
    <Image class="rounded-lg" src={boats02} alt="A photo of some sailboats in a harbour." />
    <Image class="rounded-lg" src={sunset03} alt="A photo of a sunset coloring some roofs." />
  </Wrapper>
</Layout>
