            I am a designer and self-taught developer, who
            does not back down from difficult tasks. Having
            a non-development background, I have an
            advantage in the design process â€“ I have
            experience in lots of different fields, be it
            language, music, philosophy, etc., which makes
            me a powerful ally in any situation.

            I strongly believe in teamwork, however as I am
            also a very avid learner, quick-witted, and,
            when necessary, quite independent. I always
            strive to do better and grow from even the most
            critical feedback.
