        My name is Kristjan Poska, I'm a <em>design engineer</em><span

      </h1>

      <p class="text-sm animate-fade-right animate-once animate-ease-out">
        <span class="text-[#5689cb]">*</span> I love combining design & engineering,
        ensuring code quality and facilitating collaboration between designers and
        engineers for optimal product development and innovation.

      <p

        I realised halfway through my Bachelor's that design and development are
        two areas that excite me the most in the world. It took me some time to
        get my foot in the door, but by now I can say that I'm in the room.
      </p>

      <p
        class="text-2xl sm:text-lg animate-fade-right animate-once animate-ease-out animate-delay-200">
        I take pride in being meticulous in my work and going through every
        single detail. I love systematization and organization, however I do not
        back down from presenting out-of-the-box ideas and pursuing experimental
        ideas if I see a direct connection in how it increases the experience of
        users.
      </p>

      <p
        class="text-2xl sm:text-lg animate-fade-right animate-once animate-ease-out animate-delay-300">
        I strongly believe in teamwork, however as I am also a very avid
        learner, quick-witted and pretty independent â€“ it makes me an useful
        ally in any situation.
